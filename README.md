## Overview 

The BGU Student Complaint Generator is a project designed to test and integrate various technological tools. The application uses a combination of Googleâ€™s LLM, Gemma2, Flask, HTML, CSS, and Firebase to create a functional and interactive web-based complaint generator. Docker is used to containerize the application for consistent development and deployment.


## Technologies Used
- **Google LLM (Gemma2)**: Utilized through the Groq module for generating realistic complaints.
- **Flask**: Serves as the backend server to handle requests and responses.
- **HTML & CSS**: Employed for creating a visually appealing user interface that functions well on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Firebase**: Used as the database service to store and manage user data and interactions.
- **Docker**: Used to containerize the application, ensuring consistent environments across different stages of development and deployment.

## Features
- **User Session Management**: Upon visiting the site, a cookie with a unique UUID is saved on the user's computer.
- **Conversation Storage**: All interactions between the user and the model are stored in Firebase.
- **Unique User Data**: Each userâ€™s data is kept under a unique ID in Firebaseâ€™s users collection, corresponding to their UUID.
- **Responsive Design**: CSS ensures that the site is functional and visually appealing on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Usage

1. **Initial Visit**:
   - When a new user first visits the website, a cookie with a unique UUID is saved on their computer. Simultaneously, a new entry is created in the Firebase database to track the user.

2. **Submitting a Complaint**:
   - The user can enter and submit a new complaint through the web interface.
   - The system can record a voice complaint and convert it to text.
   - Upon submission, the complaint is sent to Googleâ€™s LLM (Gemma2) via the Groq module.
   - The LLM generates a new, made-up complaint in response, which is then saved back to the Firebase database along with all previous messages exchanged between the user and the model.
   - The generated complaint can be voiced back to the user.

3. **Returning to the Website**:
   - When the user returns to the website, their conversation history is loaded from Firebase and restored to the model.
   - This allows the model to remember and continue the conversation from where it left off, providing a seamless user experience.
